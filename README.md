We chose the Apache license because it's OSI-approved, and because it goes well together with the [Solderpad Hardware License](http://solderpad.org/licenses/SHL-2.1/), which is a license for open hardware used in other related projects but not this project. We prefer the Blue Oak Model License because it's easier to read and understand.
